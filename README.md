meaning
=======

A mini site powered by [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org).   
The name of this repo means that I'm still learning MEAN.JS and falling in love with it.  

Now there is no live demo for this repo, it will be coming soon.

## Prerequisites
I think you should have some basic knowledge about [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in advance.    
You can go through their official websites directly, or view [MEAN Repo](https://github.com/linnovate/mean) / [MEAN.JS Repo](https://github.com/meanjs/mean) for reference.

**Tips**: The [history](http://blog.meanjs.org/post/76726660228/forking-out-of-an-open-source-conflict) of [MEAN(mean.io)](http://mean.io) and [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org).

And the crucial tool to run MEAN.JS application is [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), which will automate your development process.    
Make sure you have installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally via npm:
```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
What is more, make sure the MongoDB is running on the **default port 27017**.

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/just4fun/meaning.git
$ cd meaning
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

## Default User
Account: ```admin```    
Password: ```12345```

## More
This mini site only has basic posting function now, and there are bugs inevitably, I will improve it during the time I spend on learning MEAN.JS.

**Just for fun.**
